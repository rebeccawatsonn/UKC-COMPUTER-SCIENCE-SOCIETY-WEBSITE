        <p>A safe, collaborative, social space open to students and enthusiasts across any and all tech disciplines.</p>
        <p>The aim of our society is to allow student of Computer Science and any adjacent courses the opportunity to network, socialise and learn more about the industry. Members will gain a safe space to connect with like-minded individuals, and will be provided with a social and collaborative environment for students often perceived as solitary. There are opportunities to attend events to network, socialise, get study support, and develop relevant skills.  </P>
