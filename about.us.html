    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>A safe, collaborative, social space open to students and enthusiasts across any and all tech disciplines.</p>
    <p>The aim of our society is to allow students of Computer Science and any adjacent courses the opportunity to network, socialize, and learn more about the industry. Members will gain a safe space to connect with like-minded individuals and will be provided with a social and collaborative environment for students, often perceived as solitary. There are opportunities to attend events to network, socialize, get study support, and develop relevant skills.</p>
    <p>Follow us on Instagram to keep up to date with our latest events and opportunities!</p>
    <p>Contact us if you have any queries: <a href="mailto:computerscience@ksu.co.uk">computerscience@ksu.co.uk</a></p>
    <p>We look forward to seeing you there :)</p>
